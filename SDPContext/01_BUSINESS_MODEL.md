# Business Model

## Revenue Model

### Primary Revenue Streams
- **Custom Manufacturing Services**: High-mix, low-volume custom packaging jobs
- **Engineered Solutions**: Foam and plastic dunnage solutions for industrial customers
- **Order-Based Revenue**: Revenue is tied directly to customer orders flowing through the system

### Revenue Drivers
- **Order Volume**: Number of customer orders received
- **Order Value**: Size and complexity of custom jobs
- **On-Time Delivery**: Maintaining customer trust and repeat business
- **Pricing Accuracy**: Proper estimation and pricing of custom work

## Cost Structure

### Primary Cost Drivers
- **Labor Costs**: Production operators, department leads, supervisors, managers
- **Material Costs**: Raw materials for custom packaging solutions
- **Machine Capacity**: Utilization of production equipment (Water Jets, Routers, Saws, Presses, Assembly)
- **Schedule Inaccuracy**: Costs from missed deadlines, poor sequencing, material waste
- **Management Overhead**: Time spent on manual coordination, subtask creation, scheduling

### Cost Optimization Opportunities
- **Accurate Scheduling**: Better capacity planning reduces overtime and waste
- **Labor Utilization**: Optimize operator productivity through better sequencing
- **Material Timing**: Coordinate material availability with production schedules
- **Automation**: Reduce manual coordination overhead

## Margin Protection

### What Protects Margins
- **Accurate Scheduling**: Realistic capacity calculations prevent overcommitment
- **Material Timing**: Proper coordination prevents material waste and delays
- **Labor Utilization**: Optimized sequencing maximizes productive time
- **On-Time Delivery**: Maintains customer trust and avoids rush charges
- **Quality Control**: Reduces scrap and rework costs

### What Destroys Margins
- **Missed Dates**: Lost customer trust, potential penalties, rush charges
- **Poor Sequencing**: Inefficient use of labor and machine capacity
- **Schedule Inaccuracy**: Overcommitment leads to overtime, underutilization loses revenue
- **Manual Overhead**: Management time spent on coordination instead of value-added work

## Business Success Metrics

### Operational Success
- **PO On-Time / Early %**: Primary customer satisfaction metric
- **Schedule Adherence**: Percentage of jobs completed as scheduled
- **Capacity Utilization**: Effective use of available production hours
- **Productivity %**: Actual vs scheduled PPM (Parts Per Minute)

### Financial Success
- **Margin Protection**: Maintaining profitability on custom jobs
- **Labor Efficiency**: Cost per unit produced
- **Overtime Minimization**: Keeping labor costs within budget
- **Material Waste Reduction**: Minimizing scrap and rework

## Business Model Characteristics

### High-Mix, Low-Volume
- Each job is unique with different requirements
- Requires flexibility in scheduling and sequencing
- Standard work orders but variable execution
- Quality is critical - defects are costly in custom work

### Custom Manufacturing
- Long-term customer relationships depend on reliability
- Reputation built on on-time delivery and quality
- Each order requires proper estimation and scheduling
- Engineering involvement in work order creation

### Make-to-Order
- No inventory of finished goods
- Production starts when order is received
- Lead times are critical to customer satisfaction
- Material availability must coordinate with production schedule
